//! Screen capture + preprocessing (PRD §1.3 / §2.3).
//!
//! Pipeline for [`capture_screen`]:
//!   1. Grab the primary monitor with `xcap` -> physical-pixel `RgbaImage`
//!      (on Retina this is 2× the logical size, e.g. a 1440p panel yields a
//!      2880-wide buffer).
//!   2. **DPI-normalize**: divide the physical buffer by the monitor's
//!      `backingScaleFactor` so we are reasoning in *logical* points. Skipping
//!      this is the classic "macOS 2× DPI" trap that shifts every click target
//!      (PRD §2.3).
//!   3. **Downsample** to a width chosen by [`Quality`] (Low 960 / Med 1280 /
//!      High 1600, default 1280) preserving aspect ratio — never let the API
//!      do the resize for us.
//!   4. Encode PNG -> base64 (no `data:` prefix).
//!   5. Compute `scale_x = real_screen_px / sent_px` (and `scale_y`) so click
//!      coordinates returned by the model can be restored to true screen
//!      pixels: `screen_px = api_px * scale`.
//!
//! Every public function returns `anyhow::Result` and never panics — capture
//! can legitimately fail (permissions, headless CI, display sleep) and the
//! caller (the 500 ms main loop) must degrade gracefully.
