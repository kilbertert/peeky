//! Cheap-first trigger engine (PRD §2.2 L0 + L1).
//!
//! Design rule from the PRD: **use the cheapest signal that can decide.** Never
//! call a model here, never run OCR. Everything in this module is pure integer /
//! float math over a tiny 128×128 grayscale frame, plus a zero-cost `osascript`
//! probe for the foreground app context.
//!
//! The pipeline this module implements:
//!   1. Perceptual hash (DCT-based pHash) of the whole 128px frame.
//!   2. Hamming distance vs. the previous frame's hash.
//!   3. If something changed, check whether it is a *pure vertical scroll* by
//!      cross-correlating a central vertical strip against the previous frame.
//!      A scroll updates the reading-progress accumulator but does **not**
//!      produce a new utterance (PRD §2.2 L1).
//!   4. Otherwise, decide NoChange vs Meaningful by comparing the hamming
//!      distance against a sensitivity-derived threshold.
//!
//! `front_app_context()` is the L0 event-driven gate: it shells out to
//! `osascript` to read the frontmost app + focused window title (and a
//! best-effort browser tab URL). It is best-effort and never panics.
